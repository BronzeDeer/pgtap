      <h1>pgTAP</h1>

      <p>pgTAP is a suite of database functions that make it easy to write
      <a href="http://testanything.org/"
      title="Test Anything Protocol">TAP</a>-emitting unit tests in
      <code>psql</code> scripts suitable for harvesting, analysis, and
      reporting by a TAP harness, such as those used in Perl and PHP
      applications.</p>

      <p>Why would you want to unit test your database? Well, there are a
      couple of scenarios in which it can be useful</p>

      <h2>Application Development</h2>

      <p>So you write PostgreSQL-backed applications, maybe
      in <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/" title="Ruby on Rails">Rails</a>,
      or <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/"
      title="Django | The Web framework for perfectionists with deadlines">Django</a>,
      or <a href="http://www.catalystframework.org/"
      title="Cataylst: The elegant MVC framework">Catalyst</a>, and because
      you’re an
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development"
      title="Wikipedia: Agile software development">agile developer</a>, you
      write lots of tests to make sure that your application works as you
      practice iterative development. But, as one of the most important parts
      of your application, should you not also test the database? Sure, you
      write tests of your API, and the API covers the database, but that’s not
      really Unit testing, is it?</p>

      <p>pgTAP allows you to really test the database, not only verifying the
      structure of your schema, but also by exercising any views, procedures,
      functions, rules, or triggers you write. Of course you could use your
      application’s unit-testing framework to test the database, but by
      writing your tests with pgTAP, you can keep your database tests simple.
      Consider these simple tests written
      with <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/Test::More"
      title="Test::More on CPAN">Test::More</a> and the
      Perl <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc/DBI"
      title="The Perl DBI on CPAN">DBI</a> to test a custom database
      function:</p>

      <pre><code>use Test::More tests => 3;
use DBI;

my $dbh = DBI->connect('dbi:Pg:dbname=try', 'postgres', '' );

# Start a transaction.
$dbh->begin;
END { $dbh->rollback; $dbh->disconnect; }
my $domain_id = 1;
my $src_id = 2;

# Insert stuff.
is $dbh->do(
    'SELECT insert_stuff( ?, ?, ?, ?)',
    undef, 'www.foo.com', [1, 2, 3], $domain_id, $src_id
), undef, 'Inserting some stuff should return undef';

# Grab the stuff records.
ok my $stuff = $dbh->selectall_arrayref(q{
    SELECT domain_id, stuff_id
      FROM domain_stuff
     WHERE domain_id = ?
       AND src_id = $src_id
     ORDER BY stuff_id
}, undef, $domain_id, $src_id), 'Fetch the domain stuff';

# Make sure we have the right stuff.
is_deeply $stuff, [
    [ $domain_id, 1 ],
    [ $domain_id, 2 ],
    [ $domain_id, 3 ],
], 'The rows should have the right stuff';</code></pre>

      <p>The upshot is that you have to connect to the database, set up
      transactions, execute the database functions, fetch back data into Perl
      data structures, and then compare values. Now consider the equivalent
      written with pgTAP:</p>

      <pre><code>-- Start a transaction.
BEGIN;
SET client_min_messages = warning;
SELECT plan( 2 );
\set domain_id 1
\set src_id 1

-- Insert stuff.
SELECT is(
   insert_stuff( 'www.foo.com', '{1,2,3}', :domain_id, :src_id ),
    NULL,
    'insert_stuff() should return null'
);

-- Check for domain stuff records.
SELECT is(
    ARRAY(
        SELECT ARRAY[ domain_id, stuff_id ]
          FROM domain_stuff
         WHERE domain_id = :domain_id
           AND src_id = :src_id
         ORDER BY stuff_id
    ),
    ARRAY[
        ARRAY[ :domain_id, 1 ],
        ARRAY[ :domain_id, 2 ],
        ARRAY[ :domain_id, 3 ],
    ],
    'The stuff should have been associated with the domain'
);

SELECT * FROM finish();
ROLLBACK;</code></pre>

      <p>Now isn’t that a lot easier to read? Unlike the Perl tests, the pgTAP
      tests can just compare values directly in the database. There is no need
      to do any extra work to get the database interface to talk to the
      database, fetch data, convert it, etc. You just use SQL. And if you’re
      working hard to keep SQL in the database and application code in the
      application, why would you write database tests in Application code?
      Just write them in SQL and be done with it!</p>

      <h2>Module Development</h2>

      <p>If you’re developing third-party modules for PostgreSQL, such
      as <a href="http://pgfoundry.org/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=390"
      title="Custom PostgreSQL data types on pgFoundry">custom data types</a>
      or <a href="http://pgfoundry.org/softwaremap/trove_list.php?form_cat=314"
      title="PosgreSQL database portability projects on pgFoundry">portability
      functions</a>, you can of course use PostgreSQL’s standard regression test
      architecture. But if you’re doing agile development, writing tests as you
      go, which test output would you rather read? This:</p>

      <pre><code>% psql -Xd try -f pg.sql
CREATE TEMP TABLE srt (
   name CITEXT
);
CREATE TABLE
INSERT INTO srt (name)
VALUES ('aardvark'),
       ('AAA'),
       ('aba'),
       ('ABC'),
       ('abd');
INSERT 0 5
SELECT LOWER(name) as aaa FROM srt WHERE name = 'AAA'::text;
 aaa 
-----
 aaa
(1 row)
SELECT LOWER(name) as aaa FROM srt WHERE name = 'AAA'::varchar;
 aaa 
-----
 aaa
(1 row)

SELECT LOWER(name) as aaa FROM srt WHERE name = 'AAA'::bpchar;
 aaa 
-----
 aaa
(1 row)

SELECT LOWER(name) as aaa FROM srt WHERE name = 'AAA';
 aaa 
-----
 aaa
(1 row)</code></pre>

    <p>Which tests pass? Which fail? Not only is it hard to tell, but
    because <code>pg_regress</code> compares the output against an expected
    output file, you also have to <em>maintain</em> that file!</p>

    <p>In contrast, the output for the equivalent tests using pgTAP looks like
    this:</p>

    <pre><code>% pg_prove -d try pgtap.sql --verbose
pgtap....
1..4
ok 1 - Should find "AAA"::text
ok 2 - Should find "AAA"::varchar
ok 3 - Should find "AAA"::bpchar
ok 4 - Should find "AAA"
ok
All tests successful.
Files=1, Tests=4,  0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 usr  0.00 sys +  0.01 cusr  0.00 csys =  0.01 CPU)
Result: PASS
    </code></pre>

    <p><em>Now</em> can you tell what tests pass and fail? Can you tell what,
    exactly, was tested? Yeah, so can I.</p>
